# RPG Characters

This is a simple implementation of a role-playing game system.
There is no actual game logic, but the purpose of this project
is to demonstrate the creation and use of various types of Characters,
Armor and Weapons.

## Character Types

Currently, there are three types of characters:
* Warrior
* Ranger
* Mage

## Armor

Currently, there are three types of armor:
* Cloth Armor
* Leather Armor
* Plate Armor

An item of armor can be worn on the head, body or legs.
Wearing armor boosts the stats of a character.

## Weapons

Currently, there are three types of weapons:
* Melee Weapon
* Ranged Weapon
* Magic Weapon

The damage dealt by each weapon is determined by
the base damage of the weapon as well as
the stats of the character equipped with the weapon.

## Running the Program

When running the project (e.g. after cloning it and
opening it in your IDE), a brief demonstration is
shown to showcase the different functionalities of
the program.
